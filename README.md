# Running

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. In one terminal, run Storybook: `npm run storybook`
2. In another terminal, run Next.js: `npm run dev`
1. Compare the Storybook story and the Next.js page. Observe how the CSS output by Next.js includes a prefixed `mask` property, and therefore renders the styles as expected. In Storybook, it's a red box.
